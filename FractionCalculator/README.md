# FractionCalculator
This project works on building your own object class and testing it with a client class. There are two classes, Fraction and FractionCalculator. 
The Fraction class is an object that holds information about a fraction (numerator and denominator). 
It will have several constructors and both private and public methods implementing the behavior of a fraction. 
The FractionCalculator class is a class that will allow the user to enter in fractions and operations, calculating and displaying the result. It will run until the user tells it to quit.  
The FractionCalculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equivalence test. It returns the fraction in lowest terms.
